## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass

### What I learned

This challenge helped me reinforce and get more comfortable using gradients, as well as adding more basic practice laying out various elements exactly how I want them.

I learned a bit about hsla application in order to emphasize and deemphasize certain UI elements for better UX.

I also used Sass for the first time on this project, and while my code didn't end up deviating from standard CSS very much at all, I did gain an understanding of what Sass is about and was able to touch on some of the special features associated with it in this project.
